# Microsoft Power Platform

[Microsoft Power Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/get-started) is a low-code platform for rapidly building customized end-to-end business solutions. It consists of five product areas: Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, and Power Pages. Each area can be used individually or together. United by the underlying Microsoft Dataverse technology, all areas are designed for a connected experience to achieve your business goals, whether it's creating analytics, process automation, or data-driven productivity applications.

Many of the Microsoft Power Platform tools are built out in the open on GitHub.  This is the official repository for referencing all the other Power Platform related repos.
